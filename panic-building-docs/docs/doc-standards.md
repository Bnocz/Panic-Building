# Documentation Standards 
Please make sure you are observing these rules as you are creating documentation

## When to Document
If you are assigned an issue tagged `Documentation Required`, please make sure you are documenting before your issue is marked as complete.

## General Rules
- All documentation should have a **Last Updated** date at the top of the page, this is mandatory so we know if the docs are stale.
- Your docs should have correct spelling and grammar. Please double check to make sure this is the case.
- Avoid using abbreviations unless you specify what you mean beforehand - do not assume the readers know what you know.
- Please use complete sentences; the documentation should look professional, and keeping everything in point form, for example, is not acceptable.
- Use correct heading hierarchies, do not just submit text.
- When you use a code example, mark with 3 upticks ``` - do not just paste code.
- Keep your docs in the correct categories, make one if it doesn't exist.

## Doc Structure
Please follow this structure for all documentation:
1. Last Updated - when the doc was last updated (does not have to be a header, e.g. **Last Updated**: Oct. 03, 2024)
2. Overview - high level summary of the documentation
3. Documentation - split this up into categories as needed
4. Future Considerations - optional, add if there's things other developers ought to keep in mind, e.g. scalability issues
5. Conclusion - optional

2 to 5 should all be in H2 headers, `##`
